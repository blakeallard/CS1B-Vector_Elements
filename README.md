This program demonstrates the use of a vector in C++ to store and manipulate a dynamic list of integers. The program begins with a predefined list of integers, then prompts the user to input additional numbers, which are appended to the vector. Finally, it displays the entire contents of the vector. This program highlights how vectors can grow in size as elements are added and how to iterate through vectors using a range-based for loop.

Key Features:
Dynamic Storage: Uses a vector to dynamically store integers, showcasing how vectors can expand as new elements are added.

User Input: The program prompts the user to enter numbers, which are then added to the vector.

Iteration: Demonstrates iterating over a vector using a range-based for loop to display the stored numbers.

Skills Demonstrated:
Vectors in C++: Understanding and using std::vector to handle dynamic arrays.

User Input Handling: Collecting input from the user and adding it to a data structure.

Iteration with Range-based For Loop: Using a simple, efficient loop to iterate through a collection of data.

Files Included:
main.cpp â€“ Contains the main logic of the program where the vector is created, numbers are added, and the contents are displayed.
